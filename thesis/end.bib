  abstract = {Blockchains or distributed ledgers are an emerging technology that has drawn considerable interest from energy supply firms, startups, technology developers, financial institutions, national governments and the academic community. Numerous sources coming from these backgrounds identify blockchains as having the potential to bring significant benefits and innovation. Blockchains promise transparent, tamper-proof and secure systems that can enable novel business solutions, especially when combined with smart contracts. This work provides a comprehensive overview of fundamental principles that underpin blockchain technologies, such as system architectures and distributed consensus algorithms. Next, we focus on blockchain solutions for the energy industry and inform the state-of-the-art by thoroughly reviewing the literature and current business cases. To our knowledge, this is one of the first academic, peer-reviewed works to provide a systematic review of blockchain activities and initiatives in the energy sector. Our study reviews 140 blockchain research projects and startups from which we construct a map of the potential and relevance of blockchains for energy applications. These initiatives were systematically classified into different groups according to the field of activity, implementation platform and consensus strategy used.1 Opportunities, potential challenges and limitations for a number of use cases are discussed, ranging from emerging peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading and Internet of Things (IoT) applications, to decentralised marketplaces, electric vehicle charging and e-mobility. For each of these use cases, our contribution is twofold: first, in identifying the technical challenges that blockchain technology can solve for that application as well as its potential drawbacks, and second in briefly presenting the research and industrial projects and startups that are currently applying blockchain technology to that area. The paper ends with a discussion of challenges and market barriers the technology needs to overcome to get past the hype phase, prove its commercial viability and finally be adopted in the mainstream.},

  abstract = {Online Social Networks (OSN) sind zu einem integralen Bestandteil unseres t{\"a}glichen Lebens geworden. Wir artikulieren unsere Meinung, erstellen und sammeln Bilder und Videos, teilen Inhalte und Informationen mit unseren Freunden und Kollegen, kommunizieren und halten uns auf dem Laufenden {\"u}ber Geschehnisse in der Welt. Doch obwohl soziale Kommunikation inh{\"a}rent ein verteiltes, dezentrales Ph{\"a}nomen ist, folgen die meisten OSN Dienste in einer zentralistischen und monolithischen Konzeption, welche alles Wissen und alle Macht einer einzigen Organisation {\"u}berl{\"a}sst. Dies l{\"a}uft der Idee des sozialen Webs zuwider, da propriet{\"a}re und isolierte Plattformen Nutzer daran hindern, selbstbestimmt eine Netzwerkplattform zu w{\"a}hlen oder die Kontrolle {\"u}ber ihre Daten zu behalten. Um das Problem zu beheben, wurden alternative Architekturen entworfen, durch welche Kontrolle und Daten auf mehrere unabh{\"a}ngige Dienstplattformen verteilt wird. Allerdings hindern die impliziten Netzwerkeffekte gro{\ss}er Netzwerke Nutzer daran, in signifikanter Anzahl zu alternativen Angeboten zu migrieren. Dar{\"u}ber hinaus existieren keine Protokolle, welche ganzheitliche und nahtlose Interoperabilit{\"a}t und dar{\"u}ber hinaus Datenportabilit{\"a}t in OSN Diensten erm{\"o}glichen. Im Resultat wird der heutige OSN Markt von einem einzigen Dienst dominiert, welcher in der Lage war, eine signifikante Anzahl an Nutzern zu gewinnen, w{\"a}hrend eine gro{\ss}e Anzahl an konkurrierenden Diensten und alternativen Angeboten existiert, auf welche sich eine verh{\"a}ltnism{\"a}{\ss}ig kleine Zahl an Nutzern vereint.  
Zwei Probleme konnten hierbei als Hauptursache f{\"u}r die aktuelle Situation, in welcher ein OSN Dienst den gesamten Markt stark dominiert, identifiziert werden. Hierbei handelt es sich um die fehlende Unterst{\"u}tzung von Datenportabilit{\"a}t und Interoperabilit{\"a}t zwischen verschiedenen OSN Diensten.  
Das vorliegende Werk stellt Sonic vor, eine L{\"o}sung zur Anbindung beliebiger OSN Dienste untereinander in einer heterogenen F{\"o}deration von OSN Diensten. Sonic spezifiziert ein offenes Kommunikationsprotokoll sowohl als auch Datenformate, durch welche Interkonnektivit{\"a}t von OSN Diensten erm{\"o}glicht wird. Die vorgestellte Architektur unterst{\"u}tzt die Kernfunktionalit{\"a}ten heutiger OSN Dienste und erm{\"o}glicht dar{\"u}ber hinaus eine Unterst{\"u}tzung erweiterter Funktionalit{\"a}ten {\"u}ber ein Erweiterungsframework.},

  abstract = {A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hashbased proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proofof-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.},

  abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the interconnection of smart devices to collect data and make intelligent decisions. However, a lack of intrinsic security measures makes IoT vulnerable to privacy and security threats. With its ``security by design,'' Blockchain (BC) can help in addressing major security requirements in IoT. BC capabilities like immutability, transparency, auditability, data encryption and operational resilience can help solve most architectural shortcomings of IoT. This article presents a comprehensive survey on BC and IoT integration. The objective of this paper is to analyze the current research trends on the usage of BC-related approaches and technologies in an IoT context. This paper presents the following novelties, with respect to related work: (i) it covers different application domains, organizing the available literature according to this categorization, (ii) it introduces two usage patterns, i.e., device manipulation and data management (open marketplace solution), and (iii) it reports on the development level of some of the presented solutions. We also analyze the main challenges faced by the research community in the smooth integration of BC and IoT, and point out the main open issues and future research directions. Last but not least, we also present a survey about novel uses of BC in the machine economy.},

  abstract = {The paper motivates, presents, demonstrates in use, and evaluates a methodology for conducting design science (DS) research in information systems (IS). DS is of importance in a discipline oriented to the creation of successful artifacts. Several researchers have pioneered DS research in IS, yet over the past 15 years, little DS research has been done within the discipline. The lack of a methodology to serve as a commonly accepted framework for DS research and of a template for its presentation may have contributed to its slow adoption. The design science research methodology (DSRM) presented here incorporates principles, practices, and procedures required to carry out such research and meets three objectives: it is consistent with prior literature, it provides a nominal process model for doing DS research, and it provides a mental model for presenting and evaluating DS research in IS. The DS process includes six steps: problem identification and motivation, definition of the objectives for a solution, design and development, demonstration, evaluation, and communication. We demonstrate and evaluate the methodology by presenting four case studies in terms of the DSRM, including cases that present the design of a database to support health assessment methods, a software reuse measure, an Internet video telephony application, and an IS planning method. The designed methodology effectively satisfies the three objectives and has the potential to help aid the acceptance of DS research in the IS discipline.},
